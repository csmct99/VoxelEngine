# Generic Voxel Engine
I wanted to try my hand at a optimized voxel engine in Unity.
Both because I want to use it for my own projects and also as a good learning project.

I consider this project a standalone package though currently its not perfectly segmented like this.

If you want, feel free to make any pull requests though as of right now this is a solo project.
